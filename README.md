# Path-Finding-Visualizer

This project shows a visual demonstration of the Dijkstra's algorithm in java. 
<br>
It contains a 15x15 grid and each cell is a node which can be made a start point, end point, wall or empty node.
Movement is in only up, down, right and left directions.
### Node Types:
* -1 = not explored 
*  0 = start 
*  1 = finish
*  2 = wall 
*  3 = empty 
*  4 = checked
*  5 = finalpath
